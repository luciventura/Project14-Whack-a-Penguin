Project 14 from 100DaysOfSwift made using SpriteKit

This is a game made for iPad. There are two kinds of penguins: the good ones and the bad ones. The player has to hit the bad penguins when they appear on screen. Every time the user hits a bad penguin (the red ones) they make 1 point. If the user hits the good penguin (blue ones) they lose 5 points. 

I used SpriteKit for this game.
